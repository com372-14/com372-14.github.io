## What You'll Produce

You will create an HTML5 web page with a recipe.

### Step-By-Step

1) Open this [zip file](/lesson_files/tortilla-pizza.zip) which contains the text and an image for a recipe.

2) Paste the text into an HTML document. Save it in your project-portfolio folder as 02recipe.html

3) Create another folder inside your project-portfolio and name it "images".  Move the image from the zip file to this folder.

4) Mark up the text with some of the elements we’ve learned so far. At a minimum you should include headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links.  Don't forget your basic structure (doctype, html, head, title, body)

5) Link to this new page from your Project Portfolio index.html

6) Your document should [validate](http://validator.w3.org/).

7) Your work should be synced to GitHub by the start of class on Monday, September 15. If you need to use a lab computer to sync, we will have time for that at beginning of class.

8) I would encourage you to work through this as you revisit the readings from Learning Web Design; markup makes more sense when applied to a specific task.


**Important**

- Your tags must be lowercase
- Don’t forget to close your tags, except for `<br />` and `<img />`
- Test your links to make sure they work!

### Delivery 

When you have completed this project, commit it to your GitHub Project Portfolio repository.  Don't forget to add a link to this new page from your index.html page!
