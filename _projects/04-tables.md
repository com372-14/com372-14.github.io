## Read Me First

## Step-by-Step

1.  Make a list of five of your favorite movies.
2.  Search for those movies on [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com)
3.  Create an HTML file (movies.html)
4.  In the HTML file, include a heading that says something like “My Favorite Movies”
5.  Create a table that includes the following data for each of your favorite movies:

    *   Movie title
    *   Distributor
    *   Release date
    *   Box Office Gross
    *   A link to the source of your data
    *   <small>_Note: Be sure to organize your data in a logical manner—alphabetical, highest to lowest gross, newest to oldest, etc. When completed, your table should look something like this:_</small>
