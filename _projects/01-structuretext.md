## What You'll Learn

This project will allow you to practice your newfound HTML skills, add structure to text using HTML elements. 

## What You'll Produce

You will create an HTML5 web page.

## Step-by-step

1. Open [this text file](https://gist.github.com/kapipe/ee1ecd210c98e2f61ba9) which includes the first few pages of Neal Stephenson's *In the Beginning was the Command Line*.
2. Copy and paste the content of that file into your text editor.
3. Save the new file in your "project-portfolio" folder that we created in class.
4. Save the new file as a .htm or .html file.  Name your file 01beginning
4. Mark up the text so that it is valid HTML. Your document should at minimum include the following elements: html, head, title, body, h1, p, ul, and li.
5. When finished and opened in a web browser, your page should look somewhat similar to the first few pages of [the book in PDF format](http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Stephenson-CommandLine-1999.pdf).

I would encourage you to complete this check-in as you read through the assigned pages of *Learning Web Design*. <!--You will typically have seven days to complete check-ins, but this one will be due on **Wednesday, September 3** so that we can remedy any problems you might encounter. At the start of Wednesday's class we will upload your work to github.-->


**Important**

- Your tags must be lowercase
- Donâ€™t forget to close your tags, except for `<br />` and `<hr />`
- Test your links to make sure they work!
