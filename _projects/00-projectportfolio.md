## What You'll Learn

This project will teach you about critically reviewing websites.  You'll learn how to format a website review and link to other websites.

## What You'll Produce

You will create an HTML5 web page with two website critiques and two hyperlinks.  

The websites you choose to critique should not be Flash-heavy, search engines (like Google), or social networking sites (like Facebook).  

### Critique Requirements

The critique of the websites should include the following information:
1) Name of the website
2) URL of the website (this should link to the website)
3) What is the subject of the site?
4) Content: Is the content relevant to the subject of the site? Too much or not enough content?
5) Navigation: Is it easy to get from one page to another, or one section to another? Does the navigation remain consistent and it is easy to use?
6) Information Architecture: Was certain information where you thought it would be? Or, were you clicking all over the place to find what you were looking for?
7) Visual Design: Do the aesthetic decisions help or hinder the site’s working abilities, not does it look good?
8) Overall Functionality: Does the site work? Can you find what you are looking for, do what you want to do, and does it simply technically work?
9) Overall Experience: Did you get what you wanted from the site?

### Technical Stuff:

- Create a html page called 02critique.html.
- Format your critique using headings, paragraphs, bold, italics, and other elements as needed
- Link to each of your websites, launching into a new window (hint - use the `target` attribute for the link element)
- Link to this new page from your Project Portfolio index.html

**Important**

- Your tags must be lowercase
- Don’t forget to close your tags, except for `<br />` and `<hr />`
- Test your links to make sure they work!

### Delivery 

When you have completed this project, commit it to your GitHub Project Portfolio repository.  Don't forget to add a link to this new page from your index.html page!
