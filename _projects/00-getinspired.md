<!--## What You'll Learn

This module will teach you about the role wireframes play in the development process. You'll learn what they are, how they work, and where they fit in the design process.

## What You'll Produce

You will develop wireframes for your final project. You'll sketch ideas for your primary pages and then use one of the resource tools discussed in class to develop high-resolution wireframes for those interfaces.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Identify your primary interfaces. These are the key elements of your portfolio. Everyone will need to design a landing page (what visitors see when they first arrive at your site) and a resume, but other displays will depend on the information you designed in Module 4 (be sure to consult it).
- Develop a low-fidelity sketch of one of your interfaces. The landing page is a good place to start, since it's what users will see first. Ask yourself: what elements need to be upfront? How will the user know who you are and what they're looking at? Determine what elements need to be on the page (make a list if it helps) and then draw a low-fi sketch (using the web-browser sketch paper handed out in class) that lays out how those elements would be positioned on your landing page. Preserve your sketch either as a photograph or a scan.
- Turn your low-fidelity sketch into a high-fidelity wireframe. When you're satisfied with the design of your landing page, use one of the tools identified in class to turn your sketch into a high-quality wireframe. Invest some time in this - make them look professional, like a portfolio piece.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of the interfaces you identified in step 1. You need to completely spell out the design requirements for your website, which means you need a wireframe for every major interface in the site.
- Write a brief explanation of your design decisions. Briefly describe your design choices, and what led you to selecting the layout you did (keeping in mind that it's not enough to just say that you liked something - give me a smart, thoughtful rationale for why you preferred it). Compose this in Word and save your document.
- Upload everything to your AFS space or Github. Be sure to link to everything on your course page (photo sketches, wireframes, rationale). Use nested lists to group multiple links under your "Module 5" entry.-->
