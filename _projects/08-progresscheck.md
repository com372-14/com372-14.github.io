## Project Goals

Your project for this week: Upload any initial progress you’ve made on your website to Github. Consider this an accountability system. Within the next seven days you should make some degree of progress on your site—a basic structure, some content rendered in HTML, a simple grid. The specifics of that progress are up to you.
