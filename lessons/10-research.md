### On Your Own

Choose 5 different portfolios from your chose field. For each portfolio identify 3 or more strengths and 3 or more weaknesses.

### In A Small Group

Share the portfolios you have selected. As a group look closely at each and discuss both what you like and what you don't like about each.

### In a Large Group

We'll discuss what we saw and found.

### On Your Own (again)

Write a brief synthesis of your findings for your blog. What components make a successful portfolio? What can detract from a successful portfolio?

## Identifying Your Target Audience

- Who is the target audience for your website?
- What do they expect?
- What do they like?
- What makes you different or unique?

## Creating Personas

What is a persona and how do we create them?

### Persona Assignment

Who will be looking at your portfolio? What will they want to gain by doing so? Creating personas will help to ensure that we are making our site for our *users*.

Create 3 personas of your potential site users. Each persona should include the following:

1. Name and title
2. Basic information
3. Professional and personal background
4. Quote
5. Technical background
6. Favorite websites (1-3)
7. Goals
8. I need/I want statements
