## Tuesday

On Tuesday we'll welcome Clinton and Brian from [Stacked Agency](http://www.stackedagency.com/). They'll be discussing their experiences as web designers and business founders. It should be a great session!


## Thursday Assignment  - Redesign a Wikipedia Article

Wikipedia is an amazing resource, but it's interesting to think about how design can change the legibility of their articles.

### Your Assignment

- Choose any [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) article.
- Using HTML and CSS create a new and improved design for the page.

### Assignment notes

- You may use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) or a text editor such as Brackets.
- If you use, Brackets (or another text editor), follow [these steps](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2881970?hl=en) to upload your page to the web using Google Drive when you are finished.
- You can use either font stacks to declare typefaces in your CSS or use the fonts available through [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
- Look for examples of **text heavy** websites with good typography for inspiration. For example, I really like the article pages at [Medium.com](https://medium.com/).
- Don't worry about styling things like footnotes and inline references
- Using images can really enhance the article (like [Medium](https://medium.com/)'s use of a large header image) but the focus of the page should be the *content*.
- Your focus should be on making the articles easier to read, so avoid fancy script typefaces and tiny font sizes.

### Due Date

Since this assignment is taking the place of our regular class meeting, please complete the assignment and email the url to me by this **Saturday (March 1st) at midnight**.

**As always, feel free to email me with any questions.**
