## Lesson Breakdown

1. What colors did you choose for your website?  Why?
2. Adding color to your website.
3. Using color to help create a visual heirarchy / create calls to action
4. Color has meaning - we all know what the colors in [this graphic](http://carsondellosa.secure.miisolutions.net/media/cd/images/product/large/188014.jpg) represent ... so, what do you think happened when a [Papa John's](https://i.imgur.com/ILLJa.jpg) used colors in an unexpected way?
4. Discovering layout


### Cool Color Tools

There are so many great tools for playing with color online, choosing color schemes, and just generally discovering color.

- [Colour Co](http://colourco.de/) (this is really awesome - allows you to see color schemes directly in your browser)
- [What the Hex](http://yizzle.com/whatthehex/?n=2) (I am horribly bad at this game)
- [Color Hex](http://www.color-hex.com/) (insert a hex code and learn all kinds of info about it)
- [0 to 255](http://0to255.com/) (pick a color and get a range of that color shaded from lightest to darkest)
- [Hex Clock](http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/)
