## Thinking About Content

During this class, we will be working on planning our final projects.

### Content

- What content will you need to have?  
- What content is already created?  What will you need to create?  

### Navigation

- What will your menu items be?
- What pages will you need?  
- What content will go on each page?  
- How will people navigate through your website?

### Wireframing

- How will your page be laid out?
- What elements will you have on each page?  What elements will be page-specific? (For example - will your homepage have different elements than your inside pages?)

### Media

- Do you need a logo?  A main photo?  Background images?
- How will the images you choose support your message?
- What will your color scheme be?  Why?  How will you use your colors in a way that supports your message?
