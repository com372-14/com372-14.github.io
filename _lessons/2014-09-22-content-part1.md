## Shared Resources

- For students who have been having difficulty with **Brackets**, you can try another code editor.  I've put together a [tutorial on using Sublime Text](/sublimetext.html), if you would like to try this as an alternative.

## Homework

- Read [Clear and Effective Communications in Web Design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/03/clear-and-effective-communication-in-web-design/).  This is a long article.  I will be talking about it and asking you questions about it in Wednesday's class.
- Read the chapter I handed out in class.  Start thinking about your final project.
- Create a document (word, text, google docs) that outlines the following
  - An idea of what your final project will be (about 2 sentences)
  - Potential audiences for your final site (at least three audiences)
  - What you want to communicate to each of the audiences
  
So, your final document should look something like this:


## Kelly Anne's Final Project
### Planning Document

For my final project, I hope to develop a portfolio that will allow me to showcase some of my best photography and writing that I have created in the past year.  This content is important to me and I think it will allow me to demonstrate my talent.

### Audiences

1) Future Employers
  - This audience is (describe the audience).  They will find my site (how?).  I hope I can communicate (what?) to them.
2) Potential Web Design Clients
  - This audience is (describe the audience).  They will find my site (how?).  I hope I can communicate (what?) to them.
3) Potential Photography Clients
