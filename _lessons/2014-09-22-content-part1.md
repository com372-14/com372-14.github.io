## Lesson Breakdown

1. Why web design?
2. How do you start planning a website?
3. Planning content and design

## Shared Resources

- For students who have been having difficulty with **Brackets**, you can try another code editor.  I've put together a [tutorial on using Sublime Text](/sublimetext.html), if you would like to try this as an alternative.
## In-Class Activity

1. Open your **project-portfolio** in Brackets.
2. Open your index.html file.
3. In your CSS folder, create a new file named *style.css*
4. Link the your style.css file to your index.html file by putting the following line in the <head>
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">```
5. Open your **style.css** file.
6. Create a comment at the top of your CSS file.  Write your name, and then put the hex codes for your three colors in the comment (this will help you to reference them later).
7. Choose one of your colors, preferably one that is highly saturated.
8. Set this to be the color of all your links and h1's.
9. Set one of your secondary colors to be the color of your h2s.
10. On your index.html file, create a h1 and make sure that it has your name and "Project Portfolio"
11. Create an h2 under that and make the content "Classwork and Projects for COM372"
12. Add a paragraph of text under that.  Write whatever you want.  You can search google for Random Text and get a block of random text.
13. Under the paragraph, create a div and add the class *color-squares*
14. Create three divs within *color-squares*.  Write the names of your colors within them.
15. Let's walk through styling these together.

If you are finished before the end of class:

1. Try to center the text in your header


## Homework

- Read [Clear and Effective Communications in Web Design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/03/clear-and-effective-communication-in-web-design/).  This is a long article.  I will be talking about it and asking you questions about it in Wednesday's class.
