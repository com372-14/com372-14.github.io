Through sketching, sharing ideas, and refining these ideas we can begin to develop our initial site design. To do so we'll follow the design studio process.

## The Design Studio Process

The following design studio process was outlined in the book [Lean UX](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do) by Jeff Gothelf as follows:

1. Problem definition and constraints
2. Individual idea generation
3. Presentation and critique
4. Iterate and refine
5. Team idea generation

How can we apply this process to our planning?

## Step 1: Define the problem

Together we'll discuss the goals of our final project.

## Step 2: Individual idea generation

Take 15 minutes and sketch 2-3 ideas for site design. Focus on a single page of the site.

## Step 3: Presentation and critique

In small groups, share your individual ideas and give feedback on the ideas presented.

## Step 4: Iterate and refine

Based on the feedback you have received, sketch a single version of your idea. Combine ideas from your original sketches and use the feedback you have received from your classmates.

## Step 5: Team idea generation

We'll post our sketches around the room. Using sticky notes, point out **1-2 things you like** and **1-2 things you think need improvement** on each sketch.
