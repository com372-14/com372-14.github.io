## History of the Web

- Do you think Tim Berner-Lee's vision of the web has held true?

## Web Standards

- As we progress through this class, I will be referring to web standards.
- Web standards were introduced as a response to the "Browser Wars" of the 1990s
- [Why are they important?](http://www.sitepoint.com/importance-web-standards/)
  - Achieve a More Stable Web
  - Reduce Development and Maintenance Time
  - Allow Backward Compatibility and Validation
  - Increase Search Engine Success
  - Graceful Degradation Now, and in the Future
  - Common Knowledge
- [Move the Web Forward](http://movethewebforward.org/)
- [Web Standards Project](http://www.webstandards.org/learn/)
- [W3C Standards](http://www.w3.org/standards/)

## Things that are NOT standards compliant (if you see a tutorial that tells you to do one of these things, run away!)
- using tables to lay out pages ([example](http://www.ironspider.ca/webdesign102/tables4layout2.htm))
  - [Why are tables bad for layout?](http://phrogz.net/css/WhyTablesAreBadForLayout.html)
- using frames ([example](http://users.ipa.net/~djhill/frmain.html))
  - [why frames suck most of the time](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-frames-suck-most-of-the-time/)
- using invisible gifs as spacers
  - [a nostaglic look at pixel gif spacers](http://www.stemkoski.com/a-nostalgic-look-at-pixel-gif-spacers/)
- save as HTML from a word processor (like Microsoft Word)
  - [Posting Content: Don't Compose in a Word Processor!](http://cms.about.com/od/maintain-your-cms-website/a/Posting-Content-Do-Not-Compose-In-A-Word-Processor.htm)
- create websites using Adobe Flash ([example](http://www.continentalmidtown.com/))
  - [The Gradual Disappearance Of Flash Websites](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/12/the-gradual-disappearance-of-flash-websites/)

## Your filesystem
<ul>
	<li>You may be used to thinking of your computer as a series of applications, plus your media and files.</li>
	<li>Depending on how organized you are, you may be used to the concept of organizing your files into different folders.  On your OS, you probably have special folders already created: <b>Pictures, My Documents, </b>and so-on.</li>
	<li>We are going to organize everything you work on in this class into a folder in your computer.  I recommend setting up a folder in your home directory called <strong>Sites</strong>.  You may find this folder is already created - if so, great!  If not, create it now.</li>
</ul>

<!--## Version Control and You</h2>

- [GitHub For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1)
- What is Github?
- We will create our first repository and name it "project01"
- We will create a branch in this repository and name it "gh-pages".  This is a special branch that will tell GitHub that you want to create a web page using this branch.  (read more at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/))
- We will clone our repository to our computers
-->

<!--## Your First Web Page
<ul>
	<li>Open a text editor on your computer (TextEdit or Notepad).</li>
	<li>If you are using TextEdit, you will need to change the format to "Plain Text".
<ul>
	<li>Open the Format tab</li>
	<li>Choose "Make Plain Text"</li>
	<li>You can also hit Shift-Apple-T to switch to plain text</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Copy and paste basic web page from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kapipe/9250113d9d2533e723c4).</li>
	<li>Save as index.html.  Be sure to choose the file format as "Web Page".  Save the file in your new project folder (my-first-repo).
<ul>
	<li>Go to the File menu</li>
	<li>Choose Save As... (or Shift-Apple-S)</li>
	<li>Change the file extension from .txt to .html</li>
	<li>A popup will ask you if you want to append the extension ".txt" to the end. Choose "Don't Append"</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Right click, and open in Chrome.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Push Your First Web Page to GitHub</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You have made a change to your code, so you should commit it to your repository.</li>
	<li>You should give each commit a summary, and an optional description</li>
	<li>Commit your change, and then sync to your repository.</li>
	<li>This <strong>added</strong> your index.html file to your github repository.  Log into http://www.github.com/YOURNAME/REPONAME to see your repository.</li>
</ul>-->

## Assignments

### 1. Read

Read Robbins, 3-32

<!--### 2. Watch

- Watch [Let's Suck At GitHub Together!](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/101-lets-suck-at-github-together/)  (18 minutes) - Chris Coyier is a great web designer and one of the best in the business.  He demonstrates how to use github using the Tower program - a slightly different program, but this may be helpful!  Also, it's kind of fun to watch a professional completely embracing the idea of not REALLY understanding what they're doing, but not letting that stop them!
- Watch [Git for Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp6v7AXQQTY) (13 minutes) - These are the slides I went through in class; Tom Ashworth is the original author, and you can watch his presentation of it to understand Git a little better.
- Watch [Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vknMgAJqH6Q) If you're still having issues / can't quite understand Git, this is a quick tutorial on how to use Github for Mac.-->
