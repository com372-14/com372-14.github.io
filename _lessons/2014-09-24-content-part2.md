## Due For This Class

- Read [Clear and Effective Communications in Web Design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/03/clear-and-effective-communication-in-web-design/).  This is a long article.  I will be talking about it and asking you questions about it in Wednesday's class.
- Read the chapter I handed out in class.  Start thinking about your final project.
- Create a document (word, text, google docs) that outlines the following
  - An idea of what your final project will be (about 2 sentences)
  - Potential audiences for your final site (at least three audiences)
  - What you want to communicate to each of the audiences
