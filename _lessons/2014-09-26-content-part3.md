## Homework

### Read

- Read through [this guide about why using tables for layout is a bad idea](https://www.hotdesign.com/seybold/everything.html).  It was written in 2003 and presents alternatives to table-based layouts.  The audience for this site was people who were using tables for layout (which you haven't), but there is a good presentation of what using CSS for layout can look like.  We will start to use CSS for layout next week.
- Read through this guide to [working with tables in HTML](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/organizing-data-with-tables/).  It's a great introduction to tables, and also talks about using styling for tables.

### Do

- Start working on Project #4.  It will be due next Friday (October 3, 2014)
- Finish coding your resume.  Upload to GitHub.
