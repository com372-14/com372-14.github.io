## Midterm Project

<p class="lead">You will be creating a website. As your starting point, you will use a six-sided package that has text on all sides</p>

Choose a 6-sided package/box that has text on all sides. Some examples of boxes are cereal, granola bar, or frozen pizza boxes. Make sure that the box is relatively clean and does not contain food remains as you will be using it in-class over an extended period of time.

Download [the project-template](https://github.com/DMD1070/project-template) and set up the appropriate files like below:

- package (folder)
    - index.html
    - one.html
    - two.html
- css (folder)
    - normalize.css
    - style.css
- img (folder)

Take the box and determine hierarchy of its information. Imagine that the box is a website, markup all of the content on your box. Use the appropriate elements to create the hierarchy. The existing package hierarchy does not have to be maintained. Instead, create hierarchy that makes sense to you and to your design.

### Website Requirements

- Create 1 homepage and 2 internal pages.
- Use the top of the box as a header on each page.
- Use the bottom of the box as the footer on each page.
- Use the front of the box as a homepage.
- Use the back and one side of the box to create a 2-column layout for an internal page.
- Use the other column to create a second internal page.
- You must use all the text on the box.
- Your navigation must remain in the same location on each page of your site.
- You must markup and style the nutrition facts.
- Each page must be accessible from every page.
- There must be a link to the homepage on every other page (This can be an logo in your header).
- Validate your HTML and CSS on each page before turning in your assignment for a final grade.
