1. Open your project portfolio **on your computer** (not in Brackets.  We want to view the files).
2. Create a new folder - **birthday**
3. Download this zip file.  All of the files inside of it should go in your newly created **birthday** folder.
<div class="note">
Now you should have a **birthday** folder inside of your project portfolio, and inside of that **birthday** folder there are two other folders (css and img) and an index.html file.
</div>

4. Open Brackets and open your project portfolio.  Close all your currently opened files.  Open the **index.html** this is in your **birthday** folder.
5. Live preview it.
6. Add a background image to the `body`.  There is an image you can use in the `img` folder.  To do so, add the following to your CSS.
<div class="note">
Add the following to the **style.css** that is in your CSS folder.
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">background-image</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="sx">url('../img/balloons.png')</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

7. That makes our text really hard to read, doesn't it?  Add a background color to your header, footer, and .birthday-message to make the text easier to read!
