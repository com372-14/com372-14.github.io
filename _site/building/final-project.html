    <p>The Web is a powerful tool that you can use to inform people about your work and yourself. For the final course project you will be developing a portfolio site with a minimum of 4 pages.</p>

<p>You are all have different strengths and interests, so the specific content of your website will vary. However, some things all of you must include on your site. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A homepage that provides an overview of you and your interests.</li>
<li>An about section that includes a statement that you write about yourself. This also can include information about your website.</li>
<li>A resume that includes your accomplishments and is written in a format appropriate for your field.</li>
<li>Examples of your accomplishments and experience in your field including things like: samples of your work, writing samples, images, or other ways of demonstrating your skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<p>The goals of this project are to demonstrate the skills you have learned in this class as well as your professional and school experience. You should be creative when doing this. These guidelines are the minimum requirements. You are encouraged to explore and create more than the bare minimum.</p>

<h2 id="project-criteria">Project Criteria</h2>

<p>Your site must meet the following criteria.</p>

<ul>
<li>Professional appearance. It can still be fun and/or playful but there should be no spelling or grammatical errors.</li>
<li>Include working links that are easily identifiable as links.</li>
<li>Graphics and writing should be appropriate for the content of the page.</li>
<li>Also keep in mind that this site should be able to be shown to anyone, including future employers. So, no offensive material.</li>
<li>Be fully responsive to ensure compatibility with a range of devices.</li>
<li>Validated and error free HTML &amp; CSS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process-binder">Process Binder</h2>

<p>In addition to developing the site, we will be exploring the web design process over the coming weeks. I&#39;d ask that each of you purchase a three ring binder that will contain print-outs of your competitive analysis, personas, mood boards, sketches, wireframes, designs, and any other work that leads up to the development process.</p>
