<h2 id="activity-1:-a-game-with-no-rules">Activity 1: A Game with No Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Supplies needed:</strong> several decks of cards (1 for every 4 students)</p>

<p>During the browser wars, web browser vendors created their own sets of rules for the web. How could this lead to a frustrating experience for users?</p>

<p>This activity is roughly based on the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game)">Mao</a> where new players are not instructed the rules at the beginning of the game, each group of players (4-5 students) is handed a deck of cards. </p>

<p><strong>The rules of the game are as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Goal of the game is to discard all of the cards in your hand.</li>
<li>Each player is allowed to make up a rule on their own turn.</li>
<li>Each group is responsible for recording their rules for discussion after the activity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> ask one student to record the rules for their group</p>

<h2 id="activity-2:-open-sourcing-my-pizza-recipe">Activity 2: Open Sourcing My Pizza Recipe</h2>

<ol>
<li>Distribute index cards to each student.</li>
<li>Describe a very basic pizza recipe and explain that you are distributing it with an open source license. (My &quot;recipe&quot; is below).</li>
<li>Invite the students to fork the recipe and make it their own. Encourage students to be creative and stretch the boundaries of what this recipe could be. (Does it even have to be pizza?)</li>
<li>Collect all of the recipes and read a few aloud. Discuss how allowing others to modify your recipe improved or (maybe) drastically changed the recipe.</li>
</ol>

<p>** My &quot;recipe&quot;:**</p>

<ul>
<li>Pizza dough</li>
<li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
<li>Mozzarella</li>
</ul>

<p>Flatten and stretch the dough. Cover with tomatoes and cheese. Bake in the oven at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="activity-2:-about-me-remix">Activity 2: About Me Remix</h2>

<p>In open source, &quot;forking&quot; is the idea of using someone else&#39;s project as the starter point for your own (just like our pizza recipe). I&#39;ve created a simple profile page page. </p>

<ol>
<li>Visit my sample profile page](<a href="https://adamscott.makes.org/thimble/leo-the-cat">https://adamscott.makes.org/thimble/leo-the-cat</a>).</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Remix&quot; button at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Though we haven&#39;t yet learned and HTML or CSS, see how much you can customize the page. Make it about yourself, a person you look up to, or your own pet.</li>
</ol>
