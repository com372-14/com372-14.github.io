## How To

Together let's walk through [Grid: A simple guide to responsive design](http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid/) by Adam  Kaplan.

## Mobile First

Mobile first responsive web design means that we start by designing the basic mobile experience and layer on additional functionality/design for larger devices. Doing so allows us to focus on the most important bits of our site's design and content.

[This article by Brad Frost](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/) is a very thorough overview of mobile first & responsive design.

## Together

## On Your Own

On your own build a *responsive* photo gallery page. It should have at least a dozen images and adapt the design based on the user's screen size. Start by creating the mobile experience first.
